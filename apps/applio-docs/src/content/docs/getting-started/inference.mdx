Inference is a **simple** process that you can complete in **three easy steps**. The program takes an input audio file and transforms it to match the voice characteristics of the trained model, replicating the vocal characteristics, intonation, and style of the original voice.

  <TabItem label="Single Inference">
    <Steps>
      1. **Select your model**: Choose the `.pth` and `.index` files of your downloaded or trained model from the selection boxes. If models aren't displayed, refresh the model list.
      2. **Load your audio**: Select and upload your audio file in the corresponding input box.
      3. **Run the inference**: Click the convert button to start the process. Processing time depends on your CPU/GPU speed.
    </Steps>

  <TabItem label="Batch Inference">
    <Steps>
      1. **Prepare your audio files**: Place all your audio files in a folder and copy the folder path into the Input Folder field. Optionally, specify an output path for the converted audios in the Output Folder field.
      2. **Select the models**: Click the Refresh button at the top right and select your downloaded or uploaded files in the Voice model and index file boxes.
      3. **Run the inference**: Click convert to process all files. Processing time depends on your CPU/GPU speed and the number of files.

## Advanced Settings

Applio includes an "Advanced Options" section that allows you to modify various settings for optimal results. Here's a detailed explanation of each setting:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Basic Settings">
    - **Export Format**: Select the desired audio format for export.
    - **Split Audio**: Cuts the audio into segments for processing, then rejoins them. Useful for long audio files.
    - **Autotune**: Applies a soft autotune effect, recommended for singing conversions.
    - **Clean Audio**: Cleans your audio output using noise detection algorithms, recommended for speech audio.
    - **Upscale Audio**: Enhances audio quality, recommended for low-quality input files.
    - **Clean Strength**: Controls the intensity of audio cleaning. Higher values provide more cleaning but may result in compression artifacts.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Pitch & Voice Settings">
    - **Pitch**: Adjusts the tone of the model. Use negative values for male voices and positive values for female voices. For male-to-female conversion, try -12; for female-to-male, try +12.
    - **Filter Radius**: Applies respiration filtering to reduce artifacts. The value represents the filter radius and respiration reduction.
    - **Search Feature Ratio**: Controls the index search behavior. Higher ratios provide more precise matching but may result in artifacts. Recommended to leave at default.
    - **Volume Envelope**: Substitutes or blends with the volume envelope of the output.
    - **Protect Voiceless Consonants**: Safeguards distinct consonants and breathing sounds to prevent electro-acoustic tearing and other artifacts.
    - **Hop Length**: Determines the duration for the system to transition to significant pitch changes. Smaller hop lengths require more processing time but provide higher pitch accuracy.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Models & Algorithms">
    - **Pitch Extraction Algorithm**: Choose between rvmpe, crepe, or other algorithms.
    - **Embedder Model**: Select the embedder model (contentvec, japanese-hubert-base, chinese-hubert-large, or custom).
    - **Formant Shifting**: Used for male-to-female and female-to-male conversions. Adjust the **Quefrency for formant shifting** and **Timbre for formant shifting** parameters.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Post-Processing">
    **Post-Process**: Apply various effects to the output audio. Available options include:
    - **Reverb**: Set Reverb Room Size, Damping, Wet Gain, Dry Gain, Width, and Freeze Mode.
    - **Pitch Shift**: Adjust pitch shift in semitones.
    - **Limiter**: Set Limiter Threshold dB and Release Time.
    - **Gain**: Adjust gain in dB.
    - **Distortion**: Set distortion gain.
    - **Chorus**: Configure Chorus Rate Hz, Depth, Center Delay ms, Feedback, and Mix.
    - **Bitcrush**: Apply bitcrush effect to the audio.
    - **Clipping**: Set clipping threshold.
    - **Compressor**: Configure Compressor Threshold dB, Ratio, Attack ms, and Release ms.
    - **Delay**: Set Delay Seconds, Feedback, and Mix.
  </TabItem>

## Tips for Better Results

<Aside type="tip">
  What should I do if my output audio sounds robotic?
</Aside>

<Steps>
1. **Improve input quality**: Use higher quality audio files for better results.
2. **Check training quality**: If using a custom model, it may need more [training](/getting-started/training/) or could be overtrained.
3. **Clean your audio**: Remove reverb, double vocals, and noise from your acapella using [UVR 5 or MVSEP](/guides/uvr/).
4. **Verify dataset quality**: If your model's dataset contained noise, you need to [clean the dataset](/guides/how-create-datasets/).
5. **Experiment with settings**: Try different advanced settings to find the optimal configuration for your audio.
