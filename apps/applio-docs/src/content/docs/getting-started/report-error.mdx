## Common Errors and Solutions

### Installation & Dependencies

</Aside>

#### Miniconda Download Issues

If you encounter problems with automatic Miniconda download:

<Steps>

2. Install it following the standard installation process

#### Conda Wheel Building Errors

If Conda shows errors related to "Wheels" dependency:

<Aside type="caution">
Ensure Visual Studio Build Tools are installed. This requirement should be installed semi-automatically by the installer.

#### Tensorboard or Dependency Errors

If you encounter Tensorboard-related errors, it likely means dependencies weren't installed correctly.

### Runtime Errors

#### Google Colab Issues

<Aside type="note">
Unfortunately, Google Colab is currently unavailable as Google has taken measures to restrict access to Colab services, including Applio. Thanks to our team, we have been able to bring Applio back. [More information here](/getting-started/other-alternatives/).
