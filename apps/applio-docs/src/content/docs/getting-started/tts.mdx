## To start performing a text inference, go to the TTS section.

- Select the **Model with its respective index**.
- Select the **TTS Model** depending on the language you want and enter the text or add a **txt file** in the box below to convert.
- Select the **TTS Speed** (increase or decrease TTS speed).
- Finally we click on **convert** and wait for the result

<Aside type="note">
Applio is a speech-to-speech conversion software, utilizing **EdgeTTS** as middleware for running the Text-to-Speech (TTS) component. Please note the following:

- **EdgeTTS** requires an **internet connection** to function.
- We do not plan to add more TTS systems to Applio at this time.
- You **cannot add additional voices** to EdgeTTS beyond what is already provided.
- If you'd like to experiment with other TTS systems, you can use the **ElevenLabs plugin**, or run TTS through another platform and then convert it using Applio.
- This should be considered a **demonstration of Applio's capabilities**.
- **Maximum audio length is limited to 10 minutes per request**, but this could change due to Azure free tier restrictions. For more details, see the [Azure Speech service quotas and limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-services-quotas-and-limits).

Applio also features ElevenLabs TTS extension. Check the [Plugins section](/images/getting-started/plugins/) for more information.
