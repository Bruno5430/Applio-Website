## What is a Dataset?

A dataset is a collection of audio files organized in a folder that Applio uses for voice training. Creating a high-quality dataset is crucial for achieving good training results.

## Dataset Creation Process

### Step 1: Source Your Audio Files

First, you need to find or download audio files of the person or character you want to create a model for.

<Aside type="note">
- Audio files must be in **WAV or FLAC** format and of good quality
- The dataset should have **a minimum duration of 10 minutes or a maximum of 30 minutes** for optimal results
- Ensure your dataset includes a variety of tones and speech patterns so the model can handle different vocal characteristics effectively

### Step 2: Separate Vocals from Instrumental

After collecting your audio files, you need to isolate the vocals from any background music or instrumental tracks. If you're unsure how to do this, [check our audio isolation guide](/guides/uvr/).

### Step 3: Edit and Process Your Audio

Once you've separated the vocals, open [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) to edit and process your audio files.

#### Noise Gate Processing

The noise gate helps reduce background noise in audio recordings. To apply it:

<Steps>
1. Select your audio in Audacity
2. Go to the Effect menu
3. Under the Steve Daulton option, select "Noise Gate"
4. Apply the following parameters:

#### Truncate Silence

This tool removes unnecessary silences from your dataset:

<Steps>
1. Go to the Effect menu
2. Under the Special option, select "Truncate Silence"
3. Apply the following parameters:
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Before truncating silence, ensure your dataset contains only speech. Remove or reduce any other sounds such as hisses, screams, or breathing noises.

### Step 4: Export Your Processed Audio

Finally, export your processed audio files. Your dataset is now ready for [training](/getting-started/training/).

| WAV Format | FLAC Format |
| :--------- | ----------: |
| ![WAV Export Settings](/images/wav.png) | ![FLAC Export Settings](/images/flac.png) |

<Aside type="note">
Export your dataset as a single audio file, or if you split it into multiple files, ensure each segment has a duration of 10 to 15 seconds per audio file.
