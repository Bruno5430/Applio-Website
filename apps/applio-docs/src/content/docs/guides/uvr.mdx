## What is UVR5?

Ultimate Vocal Remover (UVR) is a powerful AI audio editing tool that can separate vocals from instrumentals, remove background noise, and isolate different audio components. It's essential for creating clean datasets for voice training.

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Local Installation

#### Download UVR5
To use UVR locally, download and install the program from [https://ultimatevocalremover.com/](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/)

<Aside type="note">
When running the installer, Windows may mistakenly detect it as malware due to the lack of a license. If you have concerns, you can review the program's source code or use alternative installation methods.
</Aside>

#### Download Models
After installing UVR, you need to download separation models:

<Steps>
1. Click on the ðŸ”§ icon in UVR
2. Go to "Download Center"
3. Choose your preferred models
</Steps>

### UVR Directory Structure
After installation, UVR creates the following directory structure:

<FileTree>
- Ultimate Vocal Remover/
  - models/
    - MDX_Net_Models/
      - model.ckpt
      - model_data/
        - mdx_c_configs/
          - config.yaml
    - VR_Arch_Models/
      - model.ckpt
    - Demucs_Models/
      - model.ckpt
  - logs/
  - temp/
  - settings.json
  - UVR.exe
</FileTree>

## Available Models

### RoFormer Models
**RoFormer** utilizes a Band-Split module to convert the input complex spectrogram into representations at the subband level *(currently the best performing)*.

The RoFormer method contains two pretrained models, **BS-RoFormer** and **Mel-Band RoFormer**, which have similar but not identical structures.

| Model Name | Best For | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **BS-Roformer-Viperx-1297** | Vocals & Instrumentals | Best for separating vocals and instrumentals |
| **Mel-Roformer-Viperx-1143** | Vocals & Instrumentals | Separates vocals and instrumentals |

**For higher quality results, use custom models**

#### Custom RoFormer Models

| Model Name | Best For | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **[Kim Mel Roformer](https://huggingface.co/shiromiya/audio-separation-models/tree/main/Kim-MelRoformer)** | Vocals & Instrumentals | Best local model for separating vocals and instrumentals |
| **[Aufr33 and Viperx Mel Roformer Karaoke](https://huggingface.co/shiromiya/audio-separation-models/tree/main/mel_band_roformer_karaoke_aufr33_viperx)** | Main vs Backing Vocals | Best model for separating main vocals from backing vocals |
| **[anvuew Mel Roformer dereverb](https://huggingface.co/anvuew/dereverb_mel_band_roformer/tree/main)** | Reverb Removal | Best model for removing reverb from audios *(only removes stereo reverb)* |
| **[Aufr33 Mel Roformer Denoise](https://huggingface.co/jarredou/aufr33_MelBand_Denoise/tree/main)** | Noise Removal | Best model for removing noise from audios |

<Aside type="note">
To use these custom models, you need to download the following [patch](https://github.com/TRvlvr/model_repo/releases/download/uvr_update_patches/UVR_Patch_4_14_24_18_7_BETA_full_Roformer.exe).

### MDX-Net Models
**MDX-Net** is a prize-winning model framework from an ML enthusiasts contest, designed for audio source separation and enabling improvements from a base model.

| Model Name | Best For | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **MDX23C-InstVoc HQ** | Multiple Tasks | A set of different models that work together to deliver a single result |
| **UVR-MDX-NET Voc FT** | Vocals | Model focused mainly on separating vocals |
| **UVR-MDX-NET Crowd HQ 1** | Background Vocals | Separates background vocals from main vocals |

### VR Arch Models
**VR-Arch** is a location-guided audio-visual spatial audio separator model, capable of delivering great results in most tasks.

| Model Name | Best For | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **UVR-DeEcho-DeReverb** | Reverb & Echo | Separates reverb and echo |
| **UVR-BVE-4B_SN-44100-1** | Multiple Voices | Multiple background voices separator |
| **5_Hp-Karaoke-UVR** | Background Vocals | Separates background vocals (best option) |
| **UVR-DeNoise** | Noise Removal | Removes noise and some artifacts |

### Demucs Models
**Demucs** is an all-in-one model capable of separating most objects from audio into 4 to 6 stems. The best version is DemucsV4.

| Model Name | Processing Speed | Quality | Best For |
|------------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| **htdemucs** | Normal | Good | Default model with normal processing time and good results |
| **htdemucs_ft** | Slow | Better | Slower processing but better results |
| **htdemucs_6s** | Normal | Good | Capable of separating guitar and piano stems |

## Performing Audio Conversion

Once you have downloaded the models, you can perform audio separation:

<Steps>
1. **Select the desired structure and downloaded model**
2. **Select your audio file** (you can easily download audio from sites such as [Cobalt.Tools](https://cobalt.tools/))
3. **Select the output path for the results**
4. **Click convert to start the process**
</Steps>

### Additional Options
- **Segment Size:** Larger segments consume more resources but may provide better results
- **Overlap:** Amount of overlap between prediction windows
