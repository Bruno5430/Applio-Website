Applio is a powerful, AI-driven voice conversion tool that enables you to create personalized voices or make use of a variety of pre-existing voices. Whether you prefer local installation or cloud-based usage through Google Colab, Applio is designed to be efficient and user-friendly.

## What is Applio and Where Can I Use It?

Applio allows you to easily perform voice conversion tasks, whether by creating custom voices or utilizing existing ones. With a flexible design, it supports both local installation for users with sufficient hardware resources and cloud access via Google Colab for those with limited computing power.

### Hardware Requirements for Local Installation:

- **Voice Training:** For performing voice conversion locally, your system should be equipped with a **Nvidia RTX 2000 series** graphics card or higher to ensure optimal performance.
  
- **Voice Inferring:** If your goal is to use pre-existing voices, Applio will run efficiently on most standard hardware configurations.

## Get Started

### Local Installation:

To install Applio on your PC, follow the detailed steps outlined in our comprehensive [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation/).

### Google Colab Access:

If you prefer a cloud-based solution or have limited hardware resources, you can access Applio through our [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/iahispano/applio/blob/master/assets/Applio.ipynb). 

If you're new to Google Colab or need additional help, be sure to check out our [Alternative Methods Section](/getting-started/other-alternatives/) for more guidance.
