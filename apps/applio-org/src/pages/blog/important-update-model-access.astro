        We wanted to inform our community about an important update regarding
        model access in Applio. Based on recent feedback and our commitment to
        responsible AI usage, we've made some changes to how model access works
        within our platform.

      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        We've decided to remove direct access to models through Applio. While
        these models were never hosted by us, we believe this change better
        aligns with our commitment to preventing potential misuse and
        maintaining community standards.
