        A Fresh Start
      </h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Today, we're excited to unveil our completely redesigned website. Built
        with Astro, our new platform delivers lightning-fast performance while
        maintaining the sleek, modern aesthetic you've come to expect from
        Applio.

        Why the Change?
      </h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        Our previous website served us well, but as Applio grew, we needed a
        platform that could scale with us. The new design focuses on what
        matters most: getting you to the information you need quickly and
        efficiently.
